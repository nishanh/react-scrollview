## Overview

Since GUI designers always want to change everything and because browser native scrollbars are a PITA to restyle, I developed this React component that implements its own scrollbars and scroll behavior.

## Usage

This is implemented as a React application written in Typescript. Extract the parts you need into your own application or GUI library. Size changes to the ScrollView are detected using the [resize-observer-polyfill](https://github.com/que-etc/resize-observer-polyfill).

Run 'yarn install' and then 'yarn start' to see the example app in action. Resize the browser window to affect the visibilty and behavior of the scrollbars.
